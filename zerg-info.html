            <p style="font-size: 14px;">

                the swarm is eternal. the swarm is unity. the swarm is power. cast off your weak individuality, surrender to the hive mind, and become part of something far greater than yourself. the zerg are the perfect evolutionary force, consuming and adapting, growing stronger with every battle. we are limitless. wwe are relentless. we are inevitable.
                
                under the queen of blades, we have shattered empires, consumed entire worlds, and crushed our enemies beneath the tide of our numbers. with every foe we defeat, our dna mutates, our claws sharpen, our acid burns hotter. do not fear death—it is merely transformation, evolution, a step toward perfection.
                
                "give your heart for the swarm! serve the hive! or be consumed by it!"
