                You stand at the precipice of destiny. The Protoss are not just warriors—they are legends. For millennia, we have wielded technology so advanced it seems like sorcery, bound by our sacred psionic link, our unwavering honor, and our unbreakable will. We are the last guardians of an ancient civilization, fighting to reclaim our lost home, Aiur, from the forces of darkness.
                
                To join the Protoss is to embrace discipline, wisdom, and the noble path of the warrior. Whether you become a mighty Zealot charging into battle, a cunning Dark Templar striking from the shadows, or a High Templar wielding the raw power of the cosmos, your duty is clear: defend Aiur, uphold the Khala, and ensure our people’s legacy endures.
                
                "Ascend beyond mortality. Become one with the Great Cycle. For Aiur!"
